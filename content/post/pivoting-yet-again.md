excerpt: "Another change"
---

Almost a year ago, in November 2017, I moved back into a more technical role at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and became a Database Administrator. During this time, I have wanted to relaunch my blog, as it's been over three years since I really wrote anything (yes, I'm terrible). 

Well, that time has finally come. 

After spending a few weeks, looking at various options to replace Wordpress, I finally decided on using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). Hugo was incredibly easy to set up and Netlify deploys my changes automatically when I push to GitHub. Additionally, I moved away from onlybluefeet.com and am now using tarynpivots.com. This new URL seems fitting, as I love the [`PIVOT`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot?view=sql-server-2017) function in SQL Server, and I seem to change things a lot. I have no plans on moving away from being a DBA any time soon, so my plan is it to write about the SQL Server issues we deal with at Stack Overflow, as well other SQL things.
