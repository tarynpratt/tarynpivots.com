excerpt: "Jumping into the blogging thing...finally"

Boy, I am sure behind the times with having a tech type of blog but being late is better than never. I am going to try to use this platform to discuss some of my tech journeys while I delve into my new job as a DBA developer. I have worked on SQL Server in the past but I will be venturing into Oracle development as well as more in depth SQL Server stuff. It should be fun, so I will attempt to post some thoughts here. We will see how it goes!
