Just a little blurb...I'm a former web and application developer who is currently working as a Database Developer in SQL Server. When not working, I can typically be found on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/426671/bluefeet) (I'm a moderator) or [Database Administrators](http://dba.stackexchange.com/users/9003/bluefeet). I can be reached via email at _onlybluefeet (SHIFT+2) gmail (period) com_*. 

\* If you are human, you should be able to decipher the email address.
