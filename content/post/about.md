Just a little blurb...I'm a former web and application developer, and Community Manager who is currently working as a Database Administrator at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). When I'm not at my desk, I'm probably running or pretending to be a woodworker. I can be reached via email at _onlybluefeet (SHIFT+2) gmail (period) com_*. 

\* If you are human, you should be able to decipher the email address.
