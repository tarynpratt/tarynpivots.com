      <description>In late June 2019, June 26th to be exact, we experienced an outage on Stack Overflow for about 11 minutes. It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual that we had an outage. They happen. Not often, but they do still happen. This one, however, was a little different because it was caused by a maintenance job that was running on our primary SQL Server for Stack Overflow.
The job that caused it was something I&amp;rsquo;d noticed about a month prior, but had stopped it before an actual outage occurred.</description>
