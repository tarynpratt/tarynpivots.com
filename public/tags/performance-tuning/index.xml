      <description>In my previous post, I listed out the tools I use with SQL Server. Some of the tools are SQL scripts that need to be deployed to each server. If you have 1-2 SQL Servers, manually deploying scripts might not be bad, but ideally you don&amp;rsquo;t want to manually deploy anything, so I wrote a little script that allow me to install the SQL scripts in my toolbox to any environment.</description>

      <description>I get asked a lot about the tools I use at Stack Overflow to monitor and work with our SQL Servers. I figured it might be helpful to others to make the list public. I&amp;rsquo;ll also do my best to keep it updated as things change.
The current list of both free and 3rd party paid tools is below:
Free Tools  Opserver - Stack Exchange&amp;rsquo;s Monitoring System - I pretty much live in our instances of Opserver because it gives me a one-stop shop to see the health of all of our SQL Servers</description>
