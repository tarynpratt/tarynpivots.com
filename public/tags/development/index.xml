      <description>Almost a year ago, in November 2017, I moved back into a more technical role at Stack Overflow and became a Database Administrator. During this time, I have wanted to relaunch my blog, as it&amp;rsquo;s been over three years since I really wrote anything (yes, I&amp;rsquo;m terrible).
Well, that time has finally come.
After spending a few weeks, looking at various options to replace Wordpress, I finally decided on using Hugo and Netlify.</description>

      <description>Well it&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting couple months and there are quite a few changes going on in my life, but before I get into what&amp;rsquo;s coming up, I feel that I need to give a bit of an overview of my journey thus far.
I never thought about becoming a developer. When I was growing up, I loved school (yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m weird), I loved math and science (even weirder), I was going to be a doctor, work on genetics, or something similar.</description>

      <title>Using powershell to fix server space issues</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago, we were running into severe disk space and memory issues on our development servers at work. Our set-up is a bit odd, we have 3 servers - one for the transactions, one for the web interface, and the final one for reporting. Using transactional replication we have databases that can exist on all 3 servers. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s can be a real nightmare to maintain, but anyone who works with replication already knows this.</description>

      <description>Boy, I am sure behind the times with having a tech type of blog, but being late is better than never. I am going to try to use this platform to discuss some of my tech journeys while I delve into my new job as a DBA developer. I have worked on SQL Server in the past, but I will be venturing into Oracle development as well as more in depth SQL Server stuff.</description>
