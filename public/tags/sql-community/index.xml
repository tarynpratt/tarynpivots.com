      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s T-SQL Tuesday is hosted by Jon Shaulis, who has asked that we talk about impostor syndrome. This subject is close to my heart, as I have dealt with it throughout my career.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t study computer science or engineering in college. I never even took a computer class. I sort of just fell into working as a web developer because I had someone tell me they wouldn’t hire me due to lack of experience.</description>

      <title>Finally, My first PASS Summit</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with SQL Server for a long time, and have always wanted to attend PASS. For one reason of another, with numerous employers, I hadn’t been able to go. The answer was always no. &amp;lt;insert sad face&amp;gt;
The biggest blocker was always the cost.
The conference is expensive.
Seattle is expensive.
It has always been impossible to get my employer to foot the bill for it.
This year I was incredibly lucky that my employer, Stack Overflow, paid for my trip to PASS Summit.</description>
