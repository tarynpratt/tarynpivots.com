      <description>A few weeks ago, we were running into severe disk space and memory issues on our development servers at work. Our set-up is a bit odd, we have 3 servers - one for the transactions, one for the web interface, and the final one for reporting. Using transactional replication we have databases that can exist on all 3 servers. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s can be a real nightmare to maintain, but anyone who works with replication already knows this.</description>
