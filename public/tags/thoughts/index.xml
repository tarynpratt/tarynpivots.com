      <title>T-SQL Tuesday #122 - Impostor Syndrome</title>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s T-SQL Tuesday is hosted by Jon Shaulis, who has asked that we talk about impostor syndrome. This subject is close to my heart, as I have dealt with it throughout my career.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t study computer science or engineering in college. I never even took a computer class. I sort of just fell into working as a web developer because I had someone tell me they wouldn’t hire me due to lack of experience.</description>

      <title>Finally, My first PASS Summit</title>
      <link>https://tarynpivots.com/post/my-first-pass-summit/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with SQL Server for a long time, and have always wanted to attend PASS. For one reason of another, with numerous employers, I hadn’t been able to go. The answer was always no. &amp;lt;insert sad face&amp;gt;
The biggest blocker was always the cost.
The conference is expensive.
Seattle is expensive.
It has always been impossible to get my employer to foot the bill for it.
This year I was incredibly lucky that my employer, Stack Overflow, paid for my trip to PASS Summit.</description>

      <title>Pivoting yet again - New blog and domain</title>

      <description>Almost a year ago, in November 2017, I moved back into a more technical role at Stack Overflow and became a Database Administrator. During this time, I have wanted to relaunch my blog, as it&amp;rsquo;s been over three years since I really wrote anything (yes, I&amp;rsquo;m terrible).
Well, that time has finally come.
After spending a few weeks, looking at various options to replace Wordpress, I finally decided on using Hugo and Netlify.</description>

      <description>Well it&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting couple months and there are quite a few changes going on in my life, but before I get into what&amp;rsquo;s coming up, I feel that I need to give a bit of an overview of my journey thus far.
I never thought about becoming a developer. When I was growing up, I loved school (yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m weird), I loved math and science (even weirder), I was going to be a doctor, work on genetics, or something similar.</description>

      <title>SQL Saturday Adventures</title>

      <description>A few weeks bit over a month ago, I took the plunge and attended my very first SQL Saturday, SQL Saturday #370 in Phoenix. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a chance to go to any of the local user group events or another SQL Saturday due to scheduling issues, etc. but this year I reshuffled things so I could take part. I&amp;rsquo;m really glad that I did, I truly learned a lot of stuff and I also realized I know more than I probably give myself credit for.</description>

      <title>Did somebody say pivot?</title>

      <description>Paging bluefeet, there is a PIVOT question to be answered.
While that might seem like a joke, it has really happened, especially over on Stack Overflow. If you have seen any of my posts, then the chances are that I was answering a PIVOT question (or something similar). At this time of this post almost 20% of my total answers (over 3k) have been on pivot questions.
You might ask yourself, why pivot?</description>

      <title>Late to the party</title>

      <description>Boy, I am sure behind the times with having a tech type of blog, but being late is better than never. I am going to try to use this platform to discuss some of my tech journeys while I delve into my new job as a DBA developer. I have worked on SQL Server in the past, but I will be venturing into Oracle development as well as more in depth SQL Server stuff.</description>
