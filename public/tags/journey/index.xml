      <description>Well it&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting couple months and there are quite a few changes going on in my life, but before I get into what&amp;rsquo;s coming up, I feel that I need to give a bit of an overview of my journey thus far.
I never thought about becoming a developer. When I was growing up, I loved school (yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m weird), I loved math and science (even weirder), I was going to be a doctor, work on genetics, or something similar.</description>

      <description>Boy, I am sure behind the times with having a tech type of blog, but being late is better than never. I am going to try to use this platform to discuss some of my tech journeys while I delve into my new job as a DBA developer. I have worked on SQL Server in the past, but I will be venturing into Oracle development as well as more in depth SQL Server stuff.</description>
